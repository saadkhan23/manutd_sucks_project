## 👔 Part 3: The Manager Merry-Go-Round

### Post-Ferguson Manager Performance (Ranked by Goals/Game)

1. **Mourinho** (3 seasons): 1.728 goals/game
   - Best post-Ferguson manager
   - Still 10% below Ferguson's 1.925 standard
   - Won Europa League and League Cup

2. **Solskjær** (2 full seasons): 1.658 goals/game
   - Brief attacking resurgence
   - Inconsistent results

3. **Moyes** (1 season): 1.579 goals/game
   - Immediate post-Ferguson drop
   - Cultural shock to the club

4. **Solskjær/Rangnick** (transition season): 1.474 goals/game
   - Chaotic interim period

5. **Van Gaal** (2 seasons): 1.316 goals/game
   - "Philosophy" football = boring football
   - Lowest attacking output until...

6. **Ten Hag** (2 seasons): 1.303 goals/game
   - Spent heavily, minimal improvement
   - Defensive instability

7. **Amorim** (current, 1 season): 1.000 goals/game
   - Early days but concerning start
   - Just 1 goal per game average

**Key Insight**: Even the "best" post-Ferguson manager (Mourinho) couldn't match Ferguson's attacking output. The club has cycled through 7 managers in 12 years with no clear philosophy or identity.

## 🎯 Part 4: Tactical Breakdown (2017-2025)

### Possession: Losing Control

Man Utd possession % trajectory:
- **2017**: 54.7%
- **2019**: 55.7% (peak)
- **2023**: 50.7% (lowest point)
- **2025**: 53.0%

**Comparison to Man City**:
- Man City averages **65-70% possession**
- Man Utd averages **53-56% possession**
- **10-15% possession gap** = less control, more transitions, more mistakes

### Progressive Carries: Stuck in Neutral

Progressive carries per 90 (ball progression upfield):
- **2017**: 24.4 per 90
- **2024**: 17.5 per 90 (lowest)
- **2025**: 21.1 per 90

**Key Insight**: Man Utd struggles to move the ball upfield effectively. The drop in progressive carries suggests:
- Lack of creative midfielders
- Inability to break defensive lines
- Over-reliance on individual moments vs systematic buildup

### Defensive Actions: Inconsistent Intensity

Tackles + Interceptions per 90:
- Wide variation: 24.4 to 30.9 per 90
- No clear trend or identity
- Suggests tactical confusion and manager turnover impact

## 🔍 Part 5: Why Man Utd Declined (Data-Supported Hypotheses)

### 1. **Loss of Managerial Stability**
- Ferguson: 27 years of consistent philosophy
- Post-Ferguson: 7 managers in 12 years
- Each manager brought different tactics, requiring squad overhauls
- No time to build cohesive playing style

### 2. **Failure to Evolve Tactically**
- Man City and Liverpool embraced high possession, high pressing
- Man Utd stuck between counter-attacking (Mourinho) and possession (Van Gaal/Ten Hag)
- Never committed to a clear tactical identity

### 3. **Rivals Improved While Man Utd Stagnated**
- Man City's Guardiola project (+52% attacking improvement)
- Liverpool's Klopp rebuild (+22% improvement)
- Man Utd's reactive rather than proactive approach

### 4. **Attacking Output Never Recovered**
- 23% drop in goals per game
- Affects league position, confidence, and ability to attract top talent
- Creates vicious cycle: poor results → managerial changes → more instability

### 5. **Possession and Ball Progression Issues**
- 10-15% less possession than Man City
- Declining progressive carries = inability to get into dangerous areas
- Results in fewer goal-scoring opportunities

## 📈 Part 6: Recent Form (2020-2025) - Getting Worse?

### Last 5 Seasons Average Goals/Game:
1. Man City: 2.217
2. Liverpool: 2.042
3. Arsenal: 1.868
4. Chelsea: 1.647
5. **Man Utd: 1.399** ⚠️

**Key Insight**: The most recent data shows Man Utd is declining further, not recovering. The 2020-2025 average (1.399) is even worse than the overall post-Ferguson average (1.482).

### The Amorim Era Start
- 2025 season: **1.000 goals per game**
- Lowest in the entire 26-year dataset
- Caveat: Early in the season, but alarming nonetheless

## 💡 Key Takeaways for Your Blog Post

### The Numbers Don't Lie:
1. **23% attacking decline** since Ferguson left
2. **Fell from #1 to #5** among top rivals
3. **7 managers, 0 consistent improvement**
4. **No tactical identity** - possession, pressing, progression all lag behind rivals
5. **Getting worse, not better** - recent form is the worst yet

### The Core Problem:
Manchester United's decline isn't about any single factor—it's systematic failure:
- **Strategic**: No clear long-term vision or philosophy
- **Tactical**: Inability to implement modern, cohesive playing style
- **Personnel**: Managerial instability prevents squad cohesion
- **Cultural**: Lost the winning mentality and fear factor that Ferguson instilled

### The Competitors:
While Man Utd declined, rivals embraced:
- **Man City**: Total football possession dominance (Guardiola)
- **Liverpool**: High-intensity gegenpressing (Klopp)
- **Arsenal**: Youth development + modern tactics (Arteta)

Man Utd? Still searching for an identity.
